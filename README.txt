Opens X total tabs based on the number of searches you want to do. Searches on timer every ~1.5 seconds.
Click the icon once to start, second time to pause, third time to resume. If the extension finishes then another click will start the searches again.
*After installing right-click the extension icon to go to the Options page to set your search preferences.

2/13/2014 - New Options for auto searching!
Enable auto search once every 24hr - input 0 to disable, input 1 to enable
	- When you start up Chrome the extension will check to see if you've done searches in the last 24 hours. If you haven't it will automatically start searching.

Target search hour, Target search minute - input -1 to disable(either field with -1 will disbale), hours range from 0-23, minutes range from 0-59
	- In you have enabled auto searching, the extension will only initiate auto searches if it has reached or past the target time.
	*** NOTE: This is very useful because a "new day" for Bing searches is dependant on time zone. For example, I believe my Bing search day begins at ~10:00pm PST.
